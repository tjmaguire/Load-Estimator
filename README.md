# Load-Estimator
This repository holds R code and data which develop a method to determine load (mass/time) from scenarios where flow (vol/time) data are abundant and concentration (mass/vol) data are scarce. 

The repoistory will preform two functions
1) preprocess data
2) generate loading estimates
